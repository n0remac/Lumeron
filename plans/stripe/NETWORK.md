## Networking Phase Plan

**Phase 1 – Stripe Account & Credentials**
- Create or configure the Stripe account with Payment Sheet, Customer Sessions, and relevant payment methods enabled from the Dashboard.
- Generate restricted API keys and store them in local `.env` (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, optional `STRIPE_CUSTOMER_SESSION_SECRET`).
- Document the rotation process and ensure secrets are injected via secure environment management (Vercel/Vault).

**Phase 2 – Developer Tooling**
- Install the Stripe CLI locally, authenticate, and script `stripe listen` to forward webhooks during development.
- Define mobile deep links / universal links or web routes that Payment Sheet should return to after confirmation.
- Capture expected webhook event types (PaymentIntent lifecycle, customer updates) for local testing and share sample payloads for backend developers.

**Phase 3 – Production Endpoint Configuration**
- Provision the production webhook endpoint once the API route is deployed; restrict to required events and enable automatic retries.
- Configure Vercel (or hosting platform) with the Stripe environment variables and verify build-time availability.
- Ensure domain/HTTPS settings and associated app links are correct so Payment Sheet callbacks and wallet flows (Apple Pay, Link) function end-to-end.

**Phase 4 – Monitoring & Incident Response**
- Set up Stripe dashboard alerts (failed payments, webhook endpoint failures) and route them to the team’s notification channel.
- Document playbooks for common incidents (expired keys, webhook signature mismatch, payment disputes).
- Periodically review Stripe logs and rotate secrets to maintain compliance.
